# poker-web-app

This was an attempt to make a poker web app. I'd made various poker games before, with varying levels of functionality. In the final week of cs50 (see README in repo of same name), there was a project that involved making a web app with flask sessions and user accounts, so I decided to make a web app with user accounts that can play poker synchronously. I got the game logic working on its own, made a complete schema for the database, and got accounts working.

However, when I tried to put it all together, I realized that multiplayer web apps are very complex. I'd never even deployed a singleplayer app, but nevertheless I started trying to implement web-sockets, and learned a lot, but eventually found myself in over my head. Since this was going to be my independent final project for cs50, I decided to put it on hold and do something else for that: an iOS app with Swift (see Football 3.0 repo).

I put way to much thought into this project to completely abandon it, so I'm sure to come back once I've completed some more stepping stone projects, like the iOS app.
